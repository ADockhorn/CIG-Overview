This short overview tries to provide you a guide for all equations and algorithms mentioned in the lecture Computational Intelligence in Games at the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg. It can be quite hard to understand all the little details involved without being sure about the symbols used. We hope this guide helps you during your review of the course topics.

I currently do not recommend printing this guide, because it is the first version of this kind of overview. Even if I reviewed the contents multiple times, errors are still likely. Please always refer to the actual version in the Git-Repository.

In case you have any ideas how to improve this guide please let us know by writing an e-mail or sending a pull request.
